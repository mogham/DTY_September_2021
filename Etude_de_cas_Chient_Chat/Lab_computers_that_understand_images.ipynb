    "The purpose of this laboratory is to build a first end to end reflex-based AI model to teach computers to [**understand images**](https://www.ted.com/talks/fei_fei_li_how_we_re_teaching_computers_to_understand_pictures).\n",

    "In particular, the objective of this lab is to write an AI application able to recognize cats and dogs on images. Your application will take an image as input and will be able to say wheter the image contains a dog or a cat. You will work with the data of the [**Dogs vs Cats**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) competition from Kaggle. This competition was launched in 2013 and the first place was obtained by [Pierre Sermanet](https://research.google.com/pubs/PierreSermanet.html), actually Research Scientist at Google Brain, by using the [Overfeat](http://cilvr.nyu.edu/doku.php?id=software:overfeat:start#overfeatobject_recognizer_feature_extractor) deep learning library he wrote during his PhD at New York University under the supervision of [Yann Le Cun](http://yann.lecun.com/), Director of AI Research at Facebook. He obtained $1.09%$ of classification errors. Try to do your best to approach this score!!!\n",

    "1. A traditional pattern recognition model in which hand-crafted features are extracted from images and used to represent them and to train classifiers.\n",

BoVW downplays word arrangement (spatial information in the image) and classifies based on an histogram of the frequency of visual words in image content. The set of visual words forms a visual vocabulary, which is constructed by clustering a large corpus of features. A first step will thus consist in building a visual vocabulary by clustering a large set of local features (you will used DENSE SIFT) extracted from our training image corpus.\n",

    "\n",
    "In practice, very few people train an entire Convolutional Network from scratch (with random initialization), because it is relatively rare to have a dataset of sufficient size. Instead, in image classification, it is common to use networks pre-trained on a large dataset (such as ImageNet)  and to use it either as an initialization of as a fixed feature extractor for the task of interest (**transfer learning**). Indeed, these networks have already learned features that are useful for most computer vision problems, and leveraging such features would allow us to reach a better accuracy than any method that would only rely on the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different strategies can be used in transfer learning scenarios :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The ConvNet, trained on a large image dataset such as Imagenet, is used as a fixed feature extractor. In this case, the pipeline consists in taking the pre-trained ConvNet, removing the last fully connected layer and that by treating the rest of the ConvNet architecture as a fixed feature extractor for the new dataset\n",
    "2. Fine Tuning of the ConvNet. In this case,  the weights of a part of the pretrained network are fine-tuned by continuing the backpropagation. As it as been observed that the first features of a ConvNet contain more generic features (e.g. edge detectors or color blob detectors) that should be useful to many tasks and that later layers become progressively more specific to the details of the classes contained in the original dataset, only a higher portion of the network is fine-tuned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ConvNet as a fixed feature extractor   \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the ImageNet dataset contains several \"cat\" classes (persian cat, siamese cat...) and many \"dog\" classes among its total of 1000 classes. As a consequence any model pre-trained on ImageNet will already have learned features that are relevant to our classification problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will use the VGG16 architecture which won the 2014 Imagenet competition, and is a very simple model to create and understand. The VGG Imagenet team created both a larger, slower, slightly more accurate model (VGG 19) and a smaller, faster model (VGG 16). We will be using VGG 16 since the much slower performance of VGG19 is generally not worth the very minor improvement in accuracy.\n",

    "\n",
    "Deep neural network models are often considered as  black-boxes and their performances come at the price of loss of interpretability. Indeed, they fail to provide explanations on their predictions. In high-risk domains, e.g., health care, or in a context of production, it is crucial to build trust in a model and being able to understand its behavior. This sub-fied of artificial intelligence is known as XAI (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence) (see for instance this [tutorial](https://sites.google.com/view/www20-explainable-ai-tutorial) or the DARPA initiative [here](https://www.darpa.mil/attachments/XAIProgramUpdate.pdf)).\n",
